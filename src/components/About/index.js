      <p>
        Thanks for checking out my photography! I have always loved photography,
        but in 2017 I started shooting seriously with a Nikon F2 Photomic and
        fell in love with film.

        I love shooting around the Triangle on weekends and planning trips to
        new desinations. The ocean is one of my favorite subjects.

        get in touch!
